Implement support for max_age in persistent environments. To set a max age on persistent environments, use ``PIP_RUN_RETENTION_STRATEGY=persist {"max age": "2 weeks"}``. Default is unchanged, but likely the default retention strategy will switch to ``persist {"max age": "1 day"}`` (or multiple days) in a future release.
